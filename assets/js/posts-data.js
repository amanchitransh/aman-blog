    "content": "# How to Stop Wasting Your Life \n\nIt's a regular Tuesday evening.\n\nYou're stuck in the same rush hour traffic, inching forward after a long day at work. All you want is to get home, put your feet up, and finally watch that episode you've been saving.\n\nAnd then it hits you.\n\n*Do you ever feel like life is slipping away?*\n\nLike time isn't passing anymore. It's blurring.\n\nWhen we were kids, time felt infinite. Days felt long, summers felt endless, and a year felt like a lifetime. But now, you're sitting in traffic on a random evening, wondering where the last ten years went.\n\nThe scary part? Most of us feel this way. We all know time is limited, yet none of us can clearly account for where the last five years disappeared. And the truth is, today could be that day. The day everything changes.\n\nWhether we like to admit it or not, we only have a certain amount of time on this planet. We can't afford to let it quietly pass by.\n\nSo how do we stop wasting it?\n\n### Why Time Feels Faster as We Grow Older\n\nAs children, time moved slowly. Each day felt full. Each experience felt rich.\n\nBut as we grew older, something changed.\n\nDays started blurring into weeks. Weeks into months. Months into years.\n\nOne moment it's January and you're setting goals for the year. The next moment it's July, and nothing has changed.\n\nWhat's strange is that time itself hasn't sped up. It's moving at the same pace it always has.\n\nSo what changed?\n\n**Perception.**\n\nTo a four-year-old, one year is 25% of their entire life. To a forty-year-old, it's only 2.5%. That same year simply *feels* shorter.\n\nBut perception goes even deeper than that.\n\nTime isn't something we passively observe. Our brains actively construct it. That's why, in moments of fear or danger, everything feels like it's happening in slow motion. For you, time actually *does* slow down.\n\nThis leads to one powerful idea: **Time is not objective. It's experiential.**\n\n### The Missing Ingredient: Novelty\n\nSo why did childhood feel like it lasted forever?\n\nBecause everything was new.\n\nNew places. New people. New emotions. New experiences.\n\nYour brain was constantly engaged, constantly recording. But as adults, our lives become repetitive. Same routes. Same routines. Same conversations.\n\nThere's comfort in routine, but it comes at a cost.\n\nWhen life lacks novelty, the brain stops fully paying attention. Days blur together. Years vanish without memory.\n\nThat's why your childhood feels like a completely different lifetime. Neurologically speaking, it was.\n\n### How to Make Life Feel Longer Again\n\nThe solution isn't complicated, but it does require intention.\n\n**Introduce novelty back into your life.**\n\nFor the next 30 days, actively seek new experiences whenever you can.\n\nIt doesn't have to be dramatic:\n\n-   Talk to someone new at the gym\n-   Visit a coffee shop you've never been to\n-   Take a different route home\n-   Learn a new skill\n-   Say yes to something spontaneous\n\nOr maybe it *is* dramatic:\n\n-   Move to a new city\n-   Change careers\n-   Travel alone\n-   Start something you've been afraid of\n\nGive your brain something new to process.\n\nBecause this is it. This is your life.\n\nYou might as well experience everything it has to offer.\n\n### The Truth Most People Avoid\n\nMost people run from this thought. They distract themselves, pretend it's not real, or push it far into the future.\n\nBut the truth remains: **We all have a deadline.**\n\nThat day will come.\n\nIt could be in 60 years. It could be next year. It could be next week.\n\nNo one knows.\n\nAnd if you truly understood that (not just intellectually but emotionally) you would live differently.\n\nYou wouldn't waste entire evenings scrolling. You wouldn't postpone what matters. You wouldn't live on autopilot.\n\n\"Live every day like it's your last\" sounds cliché, but do you actually live that way?\n\nBecause if you did, you wouldn't be reading about wasting time.\n\n### Put the Phone Down. Go Live.\n\nPut the phone down.\n\nGo live your life.\n\nExperience new things. Appreciate small moments. Take risks. Be present.\n\nMake decisions with the awareness that time is precious and finite.\n\nAnd if you do that, then maybe 60 years from now, you'll be able to look back and say:\n\n*I didn't waste my life.*",

    "content": "# The Year Changed. But Did We?\n\nEvery New Year arrives with fireworks, countdowns, and loud promises.\\\nA new number on the calendar.\\\nA fresh chapter, they say.\n\nBut if we are being honest, nothing truly changes at midnight.\n\nThe sun rises the same way.\\\nLife continues at the same pace.\\\nThe world does not suddenly become kinder just because the year did.\n\nYet every December, people cry for the year they are leaving behind, and every January, they beg the next one to be better. As if time itself owes us healing. As if the calendar can fix what broke inside us.\n\n2025 was not easy for me.\\\nIt tested me emotionally in ways I never expected.\\\nIt forced me to sit with silence, disappointment, unanswered questions, and versions of myself I didn't know existed. Some days, just getting through felt like an achievement.\n\nAnd still... I'm here.\n\nWhat I've learned is this:\\\nYears don't change lives. Mindsets do.\n\nYou can carry the same pain into a new year if you carry the same thoughts. You can repeat the same mistakes in a new calendar if you refuse to grow. And you can stay stuck, even in \"fresh beginnings,\" if you don't change how you see yourself and your worth.\n\nHope is not found in January 1st.\\\nHope is found in small decisions.\\\nIn choosing to respond instead of react.\\\nIn choosing to heal instead of harden.\\\nIn choosing yourself, even when it feels uncomfortable.\n\nI don't know if 2026 will be easier. No one does.\\\nBut I hope it will be gentler.\\\nI hope it heals parts of me that 2025 exposed.\\\nI hope I learn to let go without bitterness and move forward without fear.\n\nThis year, I'm not asking the universe for miracles.\\\nI'm asking myself for courage.\\\nThe courage to change my mindset.\\\nThe courage to stop romanticizing the past.\\\nThe courage to build a life that doesn't need escaping from.\n\nSo here's to a new year.\\\nNot as a savior.\\\nBut as a mirror.\n\nMay 2026 not change us.\\\nMay we change ourselves---and let that be enough. 🌱",

    "content": "# Stop Building Side Projects Like Tutorials\n\nEvery developer hears the same advice: \"Build side projects.\"\n\nSo we follow tutorials. Clone popular apps. Deploy to Vercel. Add another line to the resume.\n\nIt looks productive. It rarely makes you a better engineer.\n\n## The Real Problem\n\nMost side projects:\n- Solve already-solved problems\n- Avoid hard decisions\n- Ignore failures and scale\n- End at \"v1 is done\"\n\nReal engineering doesn't work like that.\n\n## Real Projects Have Constraints\n\nInstead of asking \"What app should I build?\"\n\nAsk: \"What problem should this system survive?\"\n\nAdd constraints:\n- What if traffic spikes?\n- What if a service goes down?\n- What if data becomes inconsistent?\n\nThe moment constraints appear, architecture matters.\n\n## Think in Systems, Not Screens\n\nStart with data flow, not UI.\n\nAsk:\n- Where can this break?\n- What must be async?\n- What needs retries?\n- What must be idempotent?\n\nEven a simple backend becomes interesting when failure is allowed.\n\n### Example: URL Shortener\n\nTutorial version:\n- Store URL in database\n- Generate short code\n- Redirect on GET\n\nSystems version:\n- What if two users get the same short code?\n- How do you handle 10k redirects/second?\n- How do you track analytics without blocking redirects?\n- What if your database is in a different region?\n\nSee the difference?\n\n## Trade-offs > Features\n\nGood engineers make trade-offs and explain them.\n\nWrite things like:\n```markdown\n## Why Redis for caching\n\nImproves latency by ~200ms.\nRisk: stale data if URL is updated.\nMitigation: 5 minute TTL.\n\n## Why async analytics\n\nSlower than sync writes.\nBut won't block redirects if analytics DB is down.\n```\n\nPut this in your README. It matters more than screenshots.\n\n## If You Can't Observe It, You Don't Own It\n\nAdd basics:\n```javascript\nlogger.info('URL created', { shortCode, userId });\nmetrics.increment('url.created');\nmetrics.timing('url.lookup', duration);\n```\n\nIf you can't answer \"what broke and why,\" the project isn't finished.\n\n## Let It Break. Then Fix It.\n\nReal systems are never done.\n\nBreak your own project:\n- Simulate database downtime\n- Send 1000 concurrent requests\n- Fill database with 1M records\n- Deploy on 512MB RAM\n- Make your API dependency timeout\n\nThen fix it. Refactor it. Scale it. Repeat.\n\nThat loop is where engineers are made.\n\n## The Resume Is a Side Effect\n\nStop building projects for your resume.\n\nBuild systems that survive failure.\n\nThe resume will take care of itself.\n",
