    "content": "# Date Someone Who Is Interested in You\n\nOne of my favorite Substack pieces this year was titled *\"date someone who is interested in you.\"* It sounds almost too obvious to be profound. And yet, after watching my own relationships unravel, and witnessing a few of my friends go through quiet, devastating endings of their own, that sentence has stayed with me. I keep returning to an old audio clip from **One Tree Hill**, not for nostalgia, but for the way it articulates something I've struggled to say out loud: the longing to be heard and seen for what lives beneath the surface.\n\nThere's a particular ache that defines our twenties. It's not always loud. Sometimes it hides behind busy schedules, constant notifications, and the comfort of always having *someone* around. We live in what many call a loneliness epidemic, yet we're rarely alone. We stay connected, but not always known. And because being alone feels terrifying, we grow complacent about who we keep close, as long as it soothes the fear of emptiness. Codependence starts to masquerade as connection.\n\nBut there's a difference between proximity and presence.\n\nWhen you look beyond the surface-level \"I love you,\" the habitual good mornings, the shared routines, you're left with harder questions. Does this person make an effort to really see you? Not just the version of you that's convenient or familiar, but the parts that change, the parts that ache, the parts that are still becoming. Do they ask questions without waiting for their turn to speak? Do they stay curious about who you are evolving into? And just as importantly, do you offer them the same attention, the same care?\n\nWe often talk about love like it's something that suddenly disappears, as if one day it simply evaporates. But love doesn't usually die from one dramatic moment. More often, it fades quietly when curiosity is replaced with assumption, when compassion gives way to complacency. When we stop asking, stop noticing, stop choosing each other with intention.\n\nThat *One Tree Hill* audio captures this truth in a way that feels almost too honest. It mirrors the heartache so many of us have felt this year: the realization that keeping someone around doesn't automatically mean you want them in your life. Familiarity can feel safe, but safety without effort becomes a cage. You can sit next to someone and still feel profoundly unseen.\n\nInterest is not passive. Care is not implied. Love is not proven by staying, but by how you show up while you're there.\n\nWhether it's a romantic partner or a friend, real connection asks something of us. It asks for effort on days when it would be easier to withdraw. It asks for curiosity when we think we already know everything. It asks for compassion, especially when it would be simpler to turn away. These things don't guarantee permanence, but they give love a fighting chance.\n\nSo maybe the lesson isn't just to date someone who is interested in you. Maybe it's also to *be* someone who is interested. Interested enough to listen deeply. Interested enough to grow together. Interested enough to choose presence over convenience.\n\nBecause in the end, love isn't sustained by the fear of being alone. It's sustained by effort, curiosity, and compassion --- again and again, beneath the surface.",

    "content": "# The Weight You Don't See\n\nLosing weight is often spoken about like a math problem. Calories in, calories out. Discipline. Routine. Consistency. Simple, they say.\n\nBut anyone who has actually tried knows the truth: weight loss is not just about food and exercise. It is about carrying a quiet, constant emotional weight that very few people talk about.\n\nBefore the body changes, the mind has already been fighting for years.\n\n* * * * *\n\n### Living Inside Insecurity\n\nBeing overweight doesn't just sit on your body, it sits in your thoughts. You become hyper-aware of yourself in rooms full of people. You adjust your clothes before sitting down. You avoid mirrors, photos, tight spaces, bright lights. You learn to read people's eyes faster than their words.\n\nSometimes the insecurity is loud, sometimes it whispers, but it is always there.\n\nAnd when you finally decide to lose weight, that insecurity doesn't disappear. In many ways, it gets louder. Because now you are watching yourself. Measuring yourself. Judging yourself. Every day becomes a silent test of worth.\n\n* * * * *\n\n### The Judgement You Didn't Ask For\n\nPeople judge in ways they don't even realize.\n\nThey comment on your plate.\\\n\"Should you be eating that?\"\\\n\"Oh, still dieting?\"\\\n\"Just have some self-control.\"\n\nThey judge when you eat. They judge when you don't. They judge your progress, your pace, your methods. Some people act like your body is a public project they are entitled to review.\n\nAnd then there is bullying, sometimes open, sometimes disguised as jokes. A laugh that lingers too long. A nickname. A comment passed off as \"motivation.\" These moments don't just hurt once, they replay. They shape how you see yourself when no one else is around.\n\n* * * * *\n\n### Not Being Able to Eat Freely\n\nOne of the hardest parts of losing weight is realizing how emotional food is.\n\nFood is celebration. Comfort. Culture. Connection. Saying \"no\" to food often feels like saying \"no\" to people. To memories. To moments you don't get back.\n\nYou sit with friends while they eat freely, and you calculate silently. You attend family functions knowing you'll be questioned if you refuse food, judged if you accept it. You feel guilt when you eat, and emptiness when you don't.\n\nThere are days when hunger is not physical, but emotional. And discipline feels less like strength and more like loneliness.\n\n* * * * *\n\n### The Mental Health Battle No One Sees\n\nWhat people rarely talk about is how mentally exhausting weight loss is.\n\nThe constant self-monitoring.\\\nThe fear of slipping back.\\\nThe shame after one bad day.\\\nThe pressure to \"prove\" that you're serious.\n\nSome days, the scale doesn't move, and it feels personal. Like all your effort was ignored. Like your body betrayed you. And in those moments, motivation doesn't just drop, it collapses.\n\nAnxiety, self-doubt, and even depression often walk alongside this journey. You start questioning your worth, your discipline, your identity. You wonder why something that looks so easy for others feels so heavy for you.\n\nAnd still, you show up.\n\n* * * * *\n\n### Why It's Still Worth It\n\nLosing weight is difficult not because you are weak, but because it demands strength in places no one applauds.\n\nIt asks you to sit with discomfort.\\\nTo choose long-term health over short-term relief.\\\nTo keep going when no one sees your effort.\\\nTo forgive yourself and try again.\n\nEvery healthy choice made on a hard day is an act of courage. Every time you continue despite judgement, insecurity, hunger, and mental exhaustion, you are building something far more important than a smaller body.\n\nYou are building resilience.\n\n* * * * *\n\n### A Reminder for Anyone Struggling\n\nIf you are on this journey and it feels unbearably hard, there is nothing wrong with you. It is hard. It is emotional. It is deeply personal.\n\nYou are not lazy.\\\nYou are not weak.\\\nYou are not failing.\n\nYou are fighting a battle that involves your body, your mind, and a world that often lacks compassion.\n\nAnd even on the days you stumble, even on the days you feel defeated, choosing to keep trying is already a victory.\n\nBe kinder to yourself. Progress is not just measured in kilograms lost, but in strength gained, habits built, and self-respect reclaimed.\n\nYour journey is valid. Your struggle is real. And you are stronger than you think.",

    "content": "# How to Stop Wasting Your Life \n\nIt's a regular Tuesday evening.\n\nYou're stuck in the same rush hour traffic, inching forward after a long day at work. All you want is to get home, put your feet up, and finally watch that episode you've been saving.\n\nAnd then it hits you.\n\n*Do you ever feel like life is slipping away?*\n\nLike time isn't passing anymore. It's blurring.\n\nWhen we were kids, time felt infinite. Days felt long, summers felt endless, and a year felt like a lifetime. But now, you're sitting in traffic on a random evening, wondering where the last ten years went.\n\nThe scary part? Most of us feel this way. We all know time is limited, yet none of us can clearly account for where the last five years disappeared. And the truth is, today could be that day. The day everything changes.\n\nWhether we like to admit it or not, we only have a certain amount of time on this planet. We can't afford to let it quietly pass by.\n\nSo how do we stop wasting it?\n\n### Why Time Feels Faster as We Grow Older\n\nAs children, time moved slowly. Each day felt full. Each experience felt rich.\n\nBut as we grew older, something changed.\n\nDays started blurring into weeks. Weeks into months. Months into years.\n\nOne moment it's January and you're setting goals for the year. The next moment it's July, and nothing has changed.\n\nWhat's strange is that time itself hasn't sped up. It's moving at the same pace it always has.\n\nSo what changed?\n\n**Perception.**\n\nTo a four-year-old, one year is 25% of their entire life. To a forty-year-old, it's only 2.5%. That same year simply *feels* shorter.\n\nBut perception goes even deeper than that.\n\nTime isn't something we passively observe. Our brains actively construct it. That's why, in moments of fear or danger, everything feels like it's happening in slow motion. For you, time actually *does* slow down.\n\nThis leads to one powerful idea: **Time is not objective. It's experiential.**\n\n### The Missing Ingredient: Novelty\n\nSo why did childhood feel like it lasted forever?\n\nBecause everything was new.\n\nNew places. New people. New emotions. New experiences.\n\nYour brain was constantly engaged, constantly recording. But as adults, our lives become repetitive. Same routes. Same routines. Same conversations.\n\nThere's comfort in routine, but it comes at a cost.\n\nWhen life lacks novelty, the brain stops fully paying attention. Days blur together. Years vanish without memory.\n\nThat's why your childhood feels like a completely different lifetime. Neurologically speaking, it was.\n\n### How to Make Life Feel Longer Again\n\nThe solution isn't complicated, but it does require intention.\n\n**Introduce novelty back into your life.**\n\nFor the next 30 days, actively seek new experiences whenever you can.\n\nIt doesn't have to be dramatic:\n\n-   Talk to someone new at the gym\n-   Visit a coffee shop you've never been to\n-   Take a different route home\n-   Learn a new skill\n-   Say yes to something spontaneous\n\nOr maybe it *is* dramatic:\n\n-   Move to a new city\n-   Change careers\n-   Travel alone\n-   Start something you've been afraid of\n\nGive your brain something new to process.\n\nBecause this is it. This is your life.\n\nYou might as well experience everything it has to offer.\n\n### The Truth Most People Avoid\n\nMost people run from this thought. They distract themselves, pretend it's not real, or push it far into the future.\n\nBut the truth remains: **We all have a deadline.**\n\nThat day will come.\n\nIt could be in 60 years. It could be next year. It could be next week.\n\nNo one knows.\n\nAnd if you truly understood that (not just intellectually but emotionally) you would live differently.\n\nYou wouldn't waste entire evenings scrolling. You wouldn't postpone what matters. You wouldn't live on autopilot.\n\n\"Live every day like it's your last\" sounds cliché, but do you actually live that way?\n\nBecause if you did, you wouldn't be reading about wasting time.\n\n### Put the Phone Down. Go Live.\n\nPut the phone down.\n\nGo live your life.\n\nExperience new things. Appreciate small moments. Take risks. Be present.\n\nMake decisions with the awareness that time is precious and finite.\n\nAnd if you do that, then maybe 60 years from now, you'll be able to look back and say:\n\n*I didn't waste my life.*",

    "content": "# The Quiet Power of Mindfulness in Daily Life\n\nIn a world that constantly pulls our attention outward, mindfulness brings us gently back to ourselves. It is the practice of being fully present in the moment without judgment. Not rushing ahead to what's next. Not replaying what's already happened. Just being here. And while it sounds simple, its impact on daily life is deeply transformative.\n\n#### 1\\. Reduces Stress Without Escaping Life\n\nMindfulness doesn't remove challenges from your life, but it changes how you experience them. When you become aware of your thoughts instead of being consumed by them, stress loses its grip. You learn to respond instead of react. Even a few minutes of mindful breathing can calm the nervous system and create space between you and overwhelm.\n\n#### 2\\. Improves Focus and Mental Clarity\n\nOur minds are often scattered between notifications, worries, and unfinished tasks. Mindfulness trains attention like a muscle. Over time, you become better at staying with one thing at a time. This improves concentration at work, makes studying more effective, and reduces mental fatigue caused by constant multitasking.\n\n#### 3\\. Builds Emotional Awareness and Regulation\n\nMindfulness helps you notice emotions as they arise instead of suppressing or acting on them impulsively. You begin to recognize patterns: what triggers frustration, anxiety, or sadness. With this awareness comes choice. You can pause, breathe, and decide how to respond rather than being driven by emotion.\n\n#### 4\\. Enhances Relationships\n\nWhen you are truly present with someone, they feel it. Mindfulness improves listening, empathy, and patience. You're less likely to interrupt, judge, or mentally drift during conversations. This presence builds trust and deeper connections, whether with friends, family, or partners.\n\n#### 5\\. Encourages Self-Compassion\n\nMany people are harsh critics of themselves. Mindfulness teaches gentle awareness, not self-judgment. You learn to observe your inner dialogue and soften it. This self-compassion reduces burnout, guilt, and the constant feeling of \"not being enough.\"\n\n#### 6\\. Improves Physical Well-being\n\nMindfulness has been linked to better sleep, lower blood pressure, and improved immune response. When the mind settles, the body follows. Being aware of your body also helps you make healthier choices around food, movement, and rest.\n\n#### 7\\. Brings Meaning to Ordinary Moments\n\nOne of the most beautiful benefits of mindfulness is how it transforms the mundane. A cup of tea, a walk home, a deep breath between tasks---these moments regain their richness. Life stops feeling like something to rush through and starts feeling like something to experience.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nMindfulness is not about perfection or emptying your mind. It's about noticing what's already there---with honesty and kindness. Practiced daily, even in small moments, it reshapes how you relate to stress, emotions, and yourself. In a noisy world, mindfulness becomes a quiet anchor---steady, grounding, and always available.",

But Did We?\n\nEvery New Year arrives with fireworks, countdowns, and loud promises.\\\nA new number on the calendar.\\\nA fresh chapter, they say.\n\nBut if we are being honest, nothing truly changes at midnight.\n\nThe sun rises the same way.\\\nLife continues at the same pace.\\\nThe world does not suddenly become kinder just because the year did.\n\nYet every December, people cry for the year they are leaving behind, and every January, they beg the next one to be better. As if time itself owes us healing. As if the calendar can fix what broke inside us.\n\n2025 was not easy for me.\\\nIt tested me emotionally in ways I never expected.\\\nIt forced me to sit with silence, disappointment, unanswered questions, and versions of myself I didn't know existed. Some days, just getting through felt like an achievement.\n\nAnd still... I'm here.\n\nWhat I've learned is this:\\\nYears don't change lives. Mindsets do.\n\nYou can carry the same pain into a new year if you carry the same thoughts. You can repeat the same mistakes in a new calendar if you refuse to grow. And you can stay stuck, even in \"fresh beginnings,\" if you don't change how you see yourself and your worth.\n\nHope is not found in January 1st.\\\nHope is found in small decisions.\\\nIn choosing to respond instead of react.\\\nIn choosing to heal instead of harden.\\\nIn choosing yourself, even when it feels uncomfortable.\n\nI don't know if 2026 will be easier. No one does.\\\nBut I hope it will be gentler.\\\nI hope it heals parts of me that 2025 exposed.\\\nI hope I learn to let go without bitterness and move forward without fear.\n\nThis year, I'm not asking the universe for miracles.\\\nI'm asking myself for courage.\\\nThe courage to change my mindset.\\\nThe courage to stop romanticizing the past.\\\nThe courage to build a life that doesn't need escaping from.\n\nSo here's to a new year.\\\nNot as a savior.\\\nBut as a mirror.\n\nMay 2026 not change us.\\\nMay we change ourselves---and let that be enough. 🌱",

    "content": "# Stop Building Side Projects Like Tutorials\n\nEvery developer hears the same advice: \"Build side projects.\"\n\nSo we follow tutorials. Clone popular apps. Deploy to Vercel.

It matters more than screenshots.\n\n## If You Can't Observe It, You Don't Own It\n\nAdd basics:\n```javascript\nlogger.info('URL created', { shortCode, userId });\nmetrics.increment('url.created');\nmetrics.timing('url.lookup', duration);\n```\n\nIf you can't answer \"what broke and why,\" the project isn't finished.\n\n## Let It Break. Then Fix It.\n\nReal systems are never done.\n\nBreak your own project:\n- Simulate database downtime\n- Send 1000 concurrent requests\n- Fill database with 1M records\n- Deploy on 512MB RAM\n- Make your API dependency timeout\n\nThen fix it. Refactor it. Scale it. Repeat.\n\nThat loop is where engineers are made.\n\n## The Resume Is a Side Effect\n\nStop building projects for your resume.\n\nBuild systems that survive failure.\n\nThe resume will take care of itself.\n",
