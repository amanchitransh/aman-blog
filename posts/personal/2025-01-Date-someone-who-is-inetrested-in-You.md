# Date Someone Who Is Interested in You

One of my favorite Substack pieces this year was titled *"date someone who is interested in you."* It sounds almost too obvious to be profound. And yet, after watching my own relationships unravel, and witnessing a few of my friends go through quiet, devastating endings of their own, that sentence has stayed with me. I keep returning to an old audio clip from **One Tree Hill**, not for nostalgia, but for the way it articulates something I've struggled to say out loud: the longing to be heard and seen for what lives beneath the surface.

There's a particular ache that defines our twenties. It's not always loud. Sometimes it hides behind busy schedules, constant notifications, and the comfort of always having *someone* around. We live in what many call a loneliness epidemic, yet we're rarely alone. We stay connected, but not always known. And because being alone feels terrifying, we grow complacent about who we keep close, as long as it soothes the fear of emptiness. Codependence starts to masquerade as connection.

But there's a difference between proximity and presence.

When you look beyond the surface-level "I love you," the habitual good mornings, the shared routines, you're left with harder questions. Does this person make an effort to really see you? Not just the version of you that's convenient or familiar, but the parts that change, the parts that ache, the parts that are still becoming. Do they ask questions without waiting for their turn to speak? Do they stay curious about who you are evolving into? And just as importantly, do you offer them the same attention, the same care?

We often talk about love like it's something that suddenly disappears, as if one day it simply evaporates. But love doesn't usually die from one dramatic moment. More often, it fades quietly when curiosity is replaced with assumption, when compassion gives way to complacency. When we stop asking, stop noticing, stop choosing each other with intention.

That *One Tree Hill* audio captures this truth in a way that feels almost too honest. It mirrors the heartache so many of us have felt this year: the realization that keeping someone around doesn't automatically mean you want them in your life. Familiarity can feel safe, but safety without effort becomes a cage. You can sit next to someone and still feel profoundly unseen.

Interest is not passive. Care is not implied. Love is not proven by staying, but by how you show up while you're there.

Whether it's a romantic partner or a friend, real connection asks something of us. It asks for effort on days when it would be easier to withdraw. It asks for curiosity when we think we already know everything. It asks for compassion, especially when it would be simpler to turn away. These things don't guarantee permanence, but they give love a fighting chance.

So maybe the lesson isn't just to date someone who is interested in you. Maybe it's also to *be* someone who is interested. Interested enough to listen deeply. Interested enough to grow together. Interested enough to choose presence over convenience.

Because in the end, love isn't sustained by the fear of being alone. It's sustained by effort, curiosity, and compassion --- again and again, beneath the surface.
