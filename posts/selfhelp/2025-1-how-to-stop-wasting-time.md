# How to Stop Wasting Your Life 

It's a regular Tuesday evening.

You're stuck in the same rush hour traffic, inching forward after a long day at work. All you want is to get home, put your feet up, and finally watch that episode you've been saving.

And then it hits you.

*Do you ever feel like life is slipping away?*

Like time isn't passing anymore. It's blurring.

When we were kids, time felt infinite. Days felt long, summers felt endless, and a year felt like a lifetime. But now, you're sitting in traffic on a random evening, wondering where the last ten years went.

The scary part? Most of us feel this way. We all know time is limited, yet none of us can clearly account for where the last five years disappeared. And the truth is, today could be that day. The day everything changes.

Whether we like to admit it or not, we only have a certain amount of time on this planet. We can't afford to let it quietly pass by.

So how do we stop wasting it?

### Why Time Feels Faster as We Grow Older

As children, time moved slowly. Each day felt full. Each experience felt rich.

But as we grew older, something changed.

Days started blurring into weeks. Weeks into months. Months into years.

One moment it's January and you're setting goals for the year. The next moment it's July, and nothing has changed.

What's strange is that time itself hasn't sped up. It's moving at the same pace it always has.

So what changed?

**Perception.**

To a four-year-old, one year is 25% of their entire life. To a forty-year-old, it's only 2.5%. That same year simply *feels* shorter.

But perception goes even deeper than that.

Time isn't something we passively observe. Our brains actively construct it. That's why, in moments of fear or danger, everything feels like it's happening in slow motion. For you, time actually *does* slow down.

This leads to one powerful idea: **Time is not objective. It's experiential.**

### The Missing Ingredient: Novelty

So why did childhood feel like it lasted forever?

Because everything was new.

New places. New people. New emotions. New experiences.

Your brain was constantly engaged, constantly recording. But as adults, our lives become repetitive. Same routes. Same routines. Same conversations.

There's comfort in routine, but it comes at a cost.

When life lacks novelty, the brain stops fully paying attention. Days blur together. Years vanish without memory.

That's why your childhood feels like a completely different lifetime. Neurologically speaking, it was.

### How to Make Life Feel Longer Again

The solution isn't complicated, but it does require intention.

**Introduce novelty back into your life.**

For the next 30 days, actively seek new experiences whenever you can.

It doesn't have to be dramatic:

-   Talk to someone new at the gym
-   Visit a coffee shop you've never been to
-   Take a different route home
-   Learn a new skill
-   Say yes to something spontaneous

Or maybe it *is* dramatic:

-   Move to a new city
-   Change careers
-   Travel alone
-   Start something you've been afraid of

Give your brain something new to process.

Because this is it. This is your life.

You might as well experience everything it has to offer.

### The Truth Most People Avoid

Most people run from this thought. They distract themselves, pretend it's not real, or push it far into the future.

But the truth remains: **We all have a deadline.**

That day will come.

It could be in 60 years. It could be next year. It could be next week.

No one knows.

And if you truly understood that (not just intellectually but emotionally) you would live differently.

You wouldn't waste entire evenings scrolling. You wouldn't postpone what matters. You wouldn't live on autopilot.

"Live every day like it's your last" sounds cliché, but do you actually live that way?

Because if you did, you wouldn't be reading about wasting time.

### Put the Phone Down. Go Live.

Put the phone down.

Go live your life.

Experience new things. Appreciate small moments. Take risks. Be present.

Make decisions with the awareness that time is precious and finite.

And if you do that, then maybe 60 years from now, you'll be able to look back and say:

*I didn't waste my life.*
